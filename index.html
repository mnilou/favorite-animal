          The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a
          member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognizable for its dark
          vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is
          an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild
          boar.
